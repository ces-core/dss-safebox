 * @title A safebox for ERC-20 tokens.
 * @notice
 * - The `owner`(MakerDAO Governance) is in full control of how much and when it can send tokens to `recipient`.
 *     - MakerDAO Governance could add other owners if required in the future (i.e.: automation of the Safebox balance).
 * - If MakerDAO governance ever executes an Emergency Shutdown, anyone can send tokens to `recipient`.
 *     - This prevents tokens being stuck in this contract when the governance smart contract is no longer operational.
 * - The `custodian` cooperation is required whenever the `owner` wants to update the `recipient`.
